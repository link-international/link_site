<p><strong>Comfix</strong></p>

<p>The precurved shape and perfect adjustability of the Comfix will make closing simple and flexible. No scratching velcro or single position snap closure anymore, just press flap on the slide and move untill the right position has been found.</p>

<strong>Fully Ventilated</strong></p>

<p>If the temperatures really exceed the normal summer values, a ventilation zipper with small opening just won&#39;t cut it. A fully vented jacket or pants will still keep you packed in safely and with all function you normally like, but it feels close to riding in a T-shirt. Large mesh ventilation panels placed at the most sufficient areas will let wind in and out without much resistance.</p>

<strong>Air Vents</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prevent yourself from overheating by opening the mesh panels on hot summer days. When ventilation is no longer needed, the panels can be quickly closed, off course with your gloves still on.</p>

<p><strong>Easy Cuff</strong></p>

Waterproof up to the rim, and easy to access whenever you&rsquo;re quickly changing the jackets&rsquo; set up. With the connection between detachable membrane and outer shell placed at the outside, accessing it is simple. Forget annoying loops and snaps pressing into your arms&rsquo; skin, get rid of the mess in your sleeves hooking to your watch and switch to easy cuff.</p>

<p><strong>Night Eye</strong></p>

<p>If jackets could have a split personality, they would probably look like this. Common grey by day, incredibly luminous at night: when placed in the range of a car&rsquo;s headlights, it&rsquo;ll light up completely! So how does this radiant fabric exactly work? Basically, it&rsquo;s coated with lots of microscopic beads. They act as satellite dishes, reflecting light back to its source, even from long distances. Indeed, just like a traffic sign!</p>

<p><strong>Side Eye</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Increase your visibility at night! Especially from the flanks the Macna Side-eye reflective parts will increase your visibility in the dark. These thermally bonded parts look smooth and will not influence the jacket&rsquo;s functionality or comfort.</p>

<p><strong>Vision Vest</strong></p>

<p>With its bright neon colour and large reflective parts it will boost your visibility day and night! The vest can be fixed onto the jacket through two integrated buckles and a build in zipper and can remain onto the jacket at all times. The Vision vest does not interfere with the jackets&rsquo; functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Raintex DL (Light and Dry)</strong></p>

<p>Raintex DL will keep water out. Not only away from your shirt but completely outside the jacket. The breathable waterproof layer is laminated directly to the outer shell, leaving no space in between these layers to store water. Because only the outer shell will get wet, the jacket will dry fast and breathability remains intact. Conventional systems absorb water. It will hit through the non waterproof outer shell and only get blocked by the waterproof layer inside. Water will get trapped in between layers, behind plastic protectors, soak your liner&hellip;&hellip;.. your jacket will end up soaked. Long drying times, weight increase and a musty smell the next morning are the results. Water in between layers will form a film blocking the membranes breathability. You will also feel water running down the membrane on the inside of a conventional system, it works like your bike&rsquo;s liquid cooling.</p>
