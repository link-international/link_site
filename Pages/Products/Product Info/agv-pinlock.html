<h4><strong>DRY HYDROPHILIC TECHNOLOGY</strong></h4>

<p>The Pinlock&reg; shield insert is made out of a material that contains moisture absorbing properties, which reacts like a sponge and absorbs moisture effectively, to keep your helmet shield fog free.</p>

<p>The inner part of the Pinlock&reg; is lined with a silicon bead, which forms an air-tight chamber when it is installed against the inside of the face shield. The pocket of air that is trapped in between the lens and shield acts as an insulator for the inside temperatures in the motorcycle helmet. Efficient absorption properties combined with the double glazed like feature, the Pinlock&reg; lens insert is the most effective,durable and affordable anti-fog solution on the market.</p>
