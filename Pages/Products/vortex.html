<h5><strong>Rear Sprockets</strong></h5>

<p>For road-going and road racing motorcycles, Vortex racing has a complete range of rear sprockets, again made in the USA using the highest quality aluminium</p>

<p>7075 T6 grade alloy is used to manufacture the supersport and superbike rears. Less rotating weight improves acceleration and allows the suspension to do its job correctly. Available in hard coating PTFE black for maximum strength and durability and in anodised red, black and blue.</p>
