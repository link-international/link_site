<h5>IT ALL STARTS WITH AN IDEA</h5>

<p>It can be a styling idea for the next jacket, or maybe a technical concept for a glove: there&#39;s always a flow of ideas going on. Some come up during a ride, others come up while showering or walking the dog. Inspiration is everywhere. The ideas are translated into a quick sketch, of which there are many lying around at our design department.</p>

<h5>AND A SAMPLE IS BORN...</h5>

<p>It&#39;s always exciting to see a new creation in the flesh! But many times, the first sample doesn&#39;t look like the product you see in stores: It can have temporary substitute parts, different colours, and other materials. But that&#39;s okay, as the first sample gets tested, cut and resewn, and drawn upon to make steps towards an end product.</p>

<h5>TIME TO HIT THE ROAD!</h5>

<p>After a few samples, feedback and modifications, the product starts to look exactly as intended, and it's about time to take it for a spin!

And admittedly , we also do it because we simply like a good ride!</p>
