<h4>General Information</h4>

<div class="row">
<div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
<p>It is extremely important to maintain your chain correctly to achieve the maximum life expectancy of your roller type drive chain. No matter what brand or type of chain you purchase, it will not last if it is incorrectly maintained.</p>

<h4>Chain Adjustment</h4>

<p>Always follow factory recommendations for chain adjustments. Adjust your chain alignment and tension to the OEM specifications for your motorcycle. New Chains: After fitting a new chain, it should be checked and adjusted after the first 50 kms and again after every 250 kms. All Chains: The chain should be checked and adjusted after every 250 kms and for any Off-road use or any type of Competition use, the chain should be checked and adjusted every 30 minutes or before each Ride or Moto.</p>

<h4>Cleaning</h4>

<p>Cleaning is a crucial step in maintaining your chain. It should be cleaned every 500 kms or less, depending on conditions i.e. Off Road or any other Competition use. Use <a href="https://www.linkint.com.au/motorcycle-product/16-710-00_item.html">Motul Chain Cleaner (16-710-00)</a> to remove grime from around the link plates and rollers. Never use contact cleaner, high pressure or steam cleaning process as this will contaminate the internal lubrication. Additionally, for sealed type chains (O, X, XW, U-ring) never use a coarse stiff brush as this will cause damage to the O-Rings.</p>
