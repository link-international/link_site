<p>MR. PLASTIC, PRESTON PETTY, MEETS PERFORMANCE PLASTICS BY POLISPORT
The Off-road business is made of pioneers. Preston Petty is a brand that reminds us all of the importance to innovate and to always reach for something better. In the &lsquo;60s Preston Petty got tired of bending and breaking steel and aluminium fenders but there was a solution for this problem and a better way to produce the best fenders for MX bikes.</p>

<h5>HISTORICAL NOSTALGIA</h5>

<p>The year was 1969 and Preston started to produce his own injection molded plastics after learning all the processes involved in plastics production. Year-by year the business grew, and with it, the Preston Pretty name became a benchmark in the off-road world. Slowly, plastics became the standard for MX and Off-road motorbikes but, at the beginning, there was the need to fight the stigma of selling plastic parts. Preston was by no means the first to make a plastic fender, but he was definitely the first to make a good quality, unbreakable product.</p>

<h5>A GREAT PARTNERSHIP</h5>

<p>Saying the plastics were unbreakable was not just a sales pitch, all the parts were unconditionally guaranteed and that was what gave the Preston Petty brand the confidence and recognition of its customers. Almost 50 years later, Preston Petty meets Polisport. The connection between these two plastics pioneers aims to bring Preston Petty Products to another level by taking advantage of all the knowledge Polisport has gathered in the Plastics field during its 40 years in the business.</p>
