<h5>DESIGNED FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE</h5>

<p>BMC air filters are designed to ensure a substantially higher air flow than original paper filters. BMC air filters are made from cotton to reduce the loss of air flow pressure passing through the air filter and through this method are able to create the best conditions for maximum power. The benefits of replacing your original paper filter with a BMC equivalent is that you will ensure your engine receives unrivalled clean air flow with substantial horsepower gains.</p>
